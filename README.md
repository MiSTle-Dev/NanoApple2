# Nano Apple IIe

The Nano Apple IIe is a port of both [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Apple-II_MiSTer) and [MiST](https://github.com/gyurco/apple2efpga) FPGA core components for the [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) computer:

This project relies on a µC being connected to the FPGA. --> [MiSTle-Dev wiki](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/.github/wiki) <--  

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't need the WIFI modem on a Nano20K/Primer25k then even the onboard BL616 µC (normally used for bitstream programming) can be used. A dedicated FPGA bitstream and FPGA companion firmware is needed in that configuration. The onboard BL616 µC is presently supported for TN20K, Console 60K, Primer25k, Mega138k Pro board. WIFI modem is supported on Console 60K too (requires antenna)

The project based on an Apple ``][+`` FPGA implementation.

## Tang Console 60k / 138K NEO

See [Tang Console 60K / 138K NEO](TANG_CONSOLE_60K.md)

## Tang Mega 60k NEO

See [Tang Mega 60K NEO](TANG_MEGA_60K.md)

## Tang Mega 138K Pro

See [Tang Mega 138K Pro](TANG_MEGA_138K.md)

## Installation

The installation on the Tang Nano 20k board can be done using a Linux PC or a Windows PC
[Instruction](INSTALLATION_WINDOWS.md).  

### Keyboard

* Win/Cmd Key - Closed Apple
* Alt Key - Open Apple
* Key **F2** toggle ```RESET```
* Key **F12** OSD

## Push Button utilization

* S1 reserved
* S2 open OSD

## Apple II slot assignments

* Slot 0 - language card (memory expansion)
* Slot 1 - not populated
* Slot 2 - Super Serial Card (SSC)
* Slot 3 - 80 col + 64K RAM expansion (//e)
* Slot 4 - Mockinboard model A (six audio channels)
* Slot 5 - Mouse Card
* Slot 6 - Disk Drive controller
* Slot 7 - Hard Disk Drive controller

## Disk format notes

Use [dsk2nib](https://github.com/slotek/dsk2nib) to convert AppleII disk images to .nib images.  

For HDD, only HDV images (raw ProDOS partition images) 32MB in size are supported.  
A Cold Reset is needed to boot from HDD.
2MG images may work if the 64-byte header is removed.
```bash
dd if=diskimage.2mg of=diskimage.hdv bs=64 skip=1
```

## Instructions

On the "Apple ][" boot screen open the OSD with F12 and choose a disk. It will boot the disk automatically. 

If you OSD press ```reset``` you'll enter Applesoft with the ] prompt.
From here you have some limited commands. See: http://www.landsnail.com/a2ref.htm.

If you want to boot another disk choose a .nib image via the osd and type the following:

```
]PR#6
```

or

```
]CALL -151`
*C600G
```

The HDD interface is in slot 7. Unlike the floppy interface, it does not stall until an image is mounted, so either press OSD ```cold reset``` or use one of the following after mounting an image:

```
]PR#7
```

or

```
]CALL -151`
*C700G
```

## OSD

invoke by F12 keypress

* Reset
* Cold Reset
* Audio Volume + / -
* Scanlines effect %
* Monitor type
* Color Palette
* SSC, HDD, MB, MOUSE disable/ enable
* CPU type
* HID device selection for Joystick Port
* Invert Joystick X/Y
* Video ROM switch
* SSC Baudrate, Parity, Mode

## Gamecontrol support

USB Gamepad Stick as Joystick (no DPAD). OSD: **USB #1** or **USB #2**  
```Button A and B``` Buttons as Trigger:  

or  
Dualshock 2 Gamepad Stick as Joystick. OSD: **DS #1** or **DS #2**<br>
<br>```square and cross``` Buttons as Trigger:<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In a [MiSTeryShield20k](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano/tree/main/board/misteryshield20k) configuration Dualshock is supported via the ``spare J8`` pinheader. <br>
> See [MiSTeryShield20k DS2 Adapter / Cable](/board/misteryshield20k_ds2_adapter/misteryshield20k_ds2_adapter_cable.md) for further information. Thx [venice1200](https://github.com/venice1200) !<br>

> [!NOTE]
> TN20k: You have to select OSD "DS2 **#2** Joy" for a ``MiSTeryShield20k`` configuration.  
> TN20k: You have to select OSD "DS2 **#1** Joy" if you use the ``Sipeed Joy to DIP`` adapter.  

or
Mouse. OSD: **Mouse**  
USB Mouse as Joystick.

## Powering

Circuit with Keyboard can be powered by Tang USB-C connector from PC or a Power Supply Adapter.

## Synthesis

Source code can be synthesized, fitted and programmed with GOWIN IDE Windows or Linux.  
Alternatively use the command line build script **gw_sh.exe** build_tn20k.tcl  

## SSC RS232 Serial Interface WIFI Modem

Have a look: [Wiki WIFI Modem](https://github.com/harbaum/FPGA-Companion/wiki/AT-Wi%E2%80%90Fi-modem)  

Connect to you WIFI AP and have a try: ``ATD`` [bbs.retrocampus.com:23](https://bbs.retrocampus.com) or just have a look at [telnetbbsguide](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/software/image-bbs) and choose as you like.
